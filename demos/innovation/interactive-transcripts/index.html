<p>
 Closed captions are great for making video accessible to non-native speakers or when audio is not available. They are supported in all editions of JW Player and loaded using WebVTT files. Beyond captions, WebVTT has many useful applications:</p>
 <ol>
    <li>Preview thumbnails are shown on the controlbar to assist seeking in the video.</li>
    <li>Chapter markers are displayed both on the controlbar and as a table of contents.</li>
    <li>A searchable transcript below the video allows for easy searching of keywords. Click on the transcript text to jump to a specific section in the video.</li>
</ol>
